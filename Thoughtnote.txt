- The code initializes the storage using the node-persist module to store student data persistently.
- The "/allStudents" POST endpoint allows the creation of a new student by accepting the student ID, name, and GPA in the request body.
  It checks for duplicate student IDs and stores the student data in the storage.
- The "/allStudents" GET endpoint retrieves all student data from the storage and generates an HTML response to display the student details. 
  If no student data is available, a message indicating the same is displayed.
- The "/allStudents/topper" GET endpoint retrieves all student data from the storage and identifies the student with the highest GPA.
  It generates an HTML response displaying the ID, name, and GPA of the topper. 
  If no topper is found or no student data is available, appropriate messages are displayed.
- The "/allStudents/:studentId" GET endpoint retrieves the data of a particular student based on the provided student ID. 
  It generates an HTML response displaying the student details. If the student is not found, a "Student not found" message is displayed.

In conclusion, the code provides a basic implementation of a student database using Node.js and Express, allowing the creation, retrieval, and display of student data.
 However, it's important to note that this implementation uses the node-persist module, which is not a traditional database solution and may not be suitable for production environments.
  It's recommended to use an actual database system for more robust and scalable applications.
